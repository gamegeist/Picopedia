<h1>Picopedia</h1>
<h2>An exhaustive collection of PICO-8 learning material, resources, and communities.</h2>

This all began as a discussion on the [r/pico8 subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pico8/comments/10a1hz6/the_ultimate_link_guide_for_pico8/) and for now, please read that post until I have time to update everything concisely.

## What is this for? 

Glad you asked. It's a way for the r/pico8 subreddit to pool all the best 
Pico-8 resources around so we can place it in the sidebar and improve the access to information. 

But it's a lot more than that, or soon will be.  

# Not Just Links, Lessons! 

- Are you an active member of the Pico-8 community?  
- Do you teach others in some way, or would you like to?  
- Are you a learner, wanting to discover all the ins and outs of the
fantasy console we all love? 

Well as of of January 13, 2023, you will be able to sign up to teach a weekly lesson 
on the Picopedia Blog! Please go ahead and read our [introductory blog post](https://github.com/gamegeist/Picopedia/issues/1) for the full details, but what we hope 
to do here is something more than just a wall of linked material. 

We want to interact and make everyone better at the things they love about Pico-8! 

# Communication 

The details on how the links will be composed and formatted is o being determined, but for now, read the reddit post, and 
keep checking up on the spreadsheet below, 

[We even have a mini forum here on the project!)](https://github.com/gamegeist/Picopedia/discussions/categories/announcements)!
